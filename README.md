## Description
---

Sets of various small helper functions useful when developing firmware.

I have been collecting this functions during years of work. Some of it I wrote  by myself others I found somewhere and added into this repository.
Main goal creation of this repository was to make life firmware engineers little bit easier because each firmware engineer know this pain when you need to write
some helpful function by your own hand because you did not find or can`t add necessary library.

So please feel free to use this toolbox and add code to this toolbox if you want.

## Installation
---

For installation you need to do 2 simply steps:

- Copy necessary ``c`` and ``h`` to your project
- Add ``#include "xxx.h"`` into your source code.

## Unit tests
